# photGalIMF

Supplementary repository of the GalIMF galaxy chemical evolution code (https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF) to calculate the photometric luminosity of simulated galaxies.

This is kept as an independent repository that may be updated with newer stellar evolution models.

The photGalIMF code takes the galaxy chemical evolution simulation results saved in (https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/tree/master/simulation_results_from_galaxy_evol) as the input and outputs the luminosity and mass-to-light ratio evolutions.
