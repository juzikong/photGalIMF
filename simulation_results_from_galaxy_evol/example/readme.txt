Here is an example of the galaxy chemical evolution result given by the GalIMF code (https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galevo.py) for a galaxy with constant SFR = 1 Msun/yr over 6 Gyr.

The 'igimf_epoch_{}'.format(epoch_number) files are galaxy-wide IMFs for stars generated at each 10 Myr timesteps. They are outputs of the GalIMF code saved in galIMF/Generated_IGIMFs.
